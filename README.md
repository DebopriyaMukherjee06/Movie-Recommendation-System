# Movie-Recommendation-System
A model classifying the top 5 movies based on the duration and release year of the movie in the user-specified genre using SVM classification in python. 
The goal is to develop a movie recommendation system using GUI. The system allows users to load a dataset of movies, preprocess the data, and train machine learning models to recommend movies based on genre. Recommendations are made using an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier that ranks movies by considering their genre, release year, and duration. The model utilizes a dataset of different movies in different genre.

The dataset consists of various features such as the movie name, rating, release-year, duration, cast, director, genre, and the description of the movie. These features are used as input to the machine learning model to classify the top 5 movies in the genre mentioned by the user.

Future enhancements include k-fold validation, advanced features, hybrid recommendations, user feedback, scalability with deep learning, adaptive thresholds, real-time predictions, and interactive visualizations for improved performance.
